## This is a day by day of my time usage for our project
### 10.3
Basic client-server setup on VirtualBox
- I have done this before, so I didn't need to do any research on the matter.
- 3 hours of work

### 11.3
Enabling ICMP for connection verification
- I did research on the internet but I finally came across a documentation done by our team member Riki which I ended up using
- 3 hours of research and 2 hour of working

### 12.3
Domain basics
- I research about the functions of an Active Directory Domain system for some time. Eventually I found a video to assist me in a basic adaptation of the system.
- I did the prework on the server-side but got stuck on the client-side because Win10 Home cannot be connected to a domain.
- 4 hours of research and 3 hours of working

### 13.3-16.3
I was on vacation

### 17.3
Domain basics
- I refreshed my memories about the subject. My previous mistakes of choosing the wrong operating system model was only a matter of changing it and trying again.
- Using previously learned things I easily made way to the point of connecting to the domain sigismund.kuttenberg . Win10 Pro succesfully connected to the domain.
- 2 hour of research and 3 hours of working

### 18.3
Had a day off

### 19.3-29.3
Had a long streak of being sick. (Back issues and Influenza)

### 30.3
Domain users and groups
- A lot of research regarding all the stuff one could configure on the server-side. After looking around decided to do a user and a group for the user.
- 4 hours of research and 3 hours of work

### 31.3
GPP & GPO
- Did some research on the matter. Don't yet completely understand it. Takes a lot more learning to become a master at this. I did a script which should have worked.
- The script works otherwise but it doesn't generate the wanted 'group.xml' file to contain the unsecure information.
- 4 hours of research and 3 hours of working

### 1.4
